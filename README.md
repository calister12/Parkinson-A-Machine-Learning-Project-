# Parkinson-A-Machine-Learning-Project-
Detection of Parkinson Disease using Machine Learning.
The proposed methodology aims to improve diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. The
proposed diagnosis system involves selection of the model and features which provide
the most accurate prediction of the result. The above-mentioned project involves
loading and summarization of dataset along with Data Visualisation and Algorithm and
parameter tuning. The classifiers used are Linear Discriminant Analysis, SVC, Decision
Tree Classifier, Gaussian NB and K Neighbours Classifier. The data is then standardized
to see the best performance is executed by which of the above-mentioned classifier.
The best model is chosen for prediction and to generate the classification report and
confusion matrix.
